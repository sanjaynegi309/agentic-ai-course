    "## üß† What is an AI Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an AI agent as a smart assistant that can understand a goal, make a plan, and use tools to achieve it. Unlike a traditional program that follows a fixed set of instructions, an agent can reason, adapt, and act autonomously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key properties of an AI agent include:\n",
    "- **Autonomy:** Agents can operate on their own without direct human supervision.\n",
    "- **Reactivity:** They can perceive their environment and respond to changes.\n",
    "- **Pro-activeness:** They can take initiative to achieve their goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, an agent is powered by a **Large Language Model (LLM)**, which acts as its brain."

    "## üõ†Ô∏è The Core Components of an Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent is typically composed of three main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The Brain (LLM):** This is the language model (like Google's Gemini) that powers the agent's reasoning and decision-making.\n",
    "2.  **Tools:** These are functions or APIs that the agent can use to interact with the outside world. Examples include a web search tool, a calculator, or a code interpreter.\n",
    "3.  **Memory:** This allows the agent to remember past interactions and context, enabling more coherent and intelligent conversations.\n",

    "1.  **`ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`**: We first create an instance of the Gemini Pro model via LangChain's wrapper. This is the core reasoning engine.\n",
    "2.  **`load_tools`**: We load the DuckDuckGo search tool (`ddg-search`). This gives the agent the ability to browse the web.\n",
    "3.  **`initialize_agent`**: This is where the magic happens. We combine the LLM and the tools into an agent. \n",
    "    - **`AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION`**: This is a specific type of agent that decides which tool to use based on the tool's description. The \"REACT\" part stands for \"Reasoning and Acting,\" which is the process you saw in the output when `verbose=True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the agent, it:\n",
    "- **Thinks:** \"I need to find the current CEO of OpenAI. I should use a search tool for this.\"\n",
    "- **Acts:** It calls the DuckDuckGo search tool with a query like \"current CEO of OpenAI\".\n",
    "- **Observes:** It gets the search results.\n",
    "- **Thinks:** \"The search results say Sam Altman is the CEO. I have enough information to answer the user's question.\"\n",
    "- **Responds:** It gives you the final answer."
