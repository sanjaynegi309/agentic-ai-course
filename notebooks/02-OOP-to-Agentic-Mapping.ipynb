    "- **`CodeWriterTool(...)`**: This is a **Method**. It's a specific capability that we attach to our agent blueprint.\n",
    "- **`project_crew.kickoff()`**: This is where the **Object** (the agent instance) is actually created and put to work. The `Crew` manages the lifecycle of the agent instance.\n",
    "- **Memory/State**: CrewAI automatically manages the agent's memory (its **Attributes** or state). The agent remembers the task it was given and the results of its actions. We'll dive deeper into memory in a later chapter."

    "- **Build Modular Systems:** Create reusable agent templates (like classes) that can be instantiated in different scenarios (like objects).\n",
